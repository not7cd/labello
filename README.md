# Labello

Aim of this project is to create label library and control software for zebra printer and other alike.

## Development

```bash
# we are using poetry for dependency management
poetry install

# run once to create secrets
source env.sh

# run once to create database
poetry run python helpers/db_create.py

# run app in for development in virtual env
FLASK_APP=labello.web FLASK_ENV=development poetry run flask run
# or
poetry run python -m labello
```

## Configuration

Labello uses CUPS to print labels. You can configure the printer name and CUPS host using environment variables:

- `LABELLO_PRINTER_NAME`: Name of the printer as configured in CUPS (default: `Zebra_LP2824`).
- `LABELLO_PRINTER_HOST`: CUPS host and port (default: `192.168.88.119:631`).

Other configurable variables:
- `LABELLO_SECRET_KEY`: Flask secret key (autogenerated by `source env.sh`).
- `LABELLO_BASE_URL`: Base URL for the application.
- `LABELLO_HOME_URL`: Home URL for branding.
- `LABELLO_IMAGES_PATH`: Path to store rendered label images.

You can set these in your environment or add them to `env.sh`.
